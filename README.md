FRET: Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool
=============================================

Introduction
------------

FRET is a framework for the elicitation, specification, formalization, and analysis of (probabilistic and non-probabilistic) system requirements. It enables users to specify unambiguous requirements using restricted English sentences while providing multiple representations to enhance clarity and validation of semantics. These representations include natural language descriptions and formal logics, allowing users with different expertise to review and understand the precise meaning of each requirement.

We extended the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) to support the specification of intuitive but unambiguous probabilistic requirements. Our tool present a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic, and formally prove that the generated formulas are well-formed.
